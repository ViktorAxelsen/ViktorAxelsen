## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m currently a CS Ph.D. student at **Nanyang Technological University (NTU)**.  
Previously, I earned my **B.E.** from *Tianjin University* and **M.S.** from *Tsinghua University*.  

My early research primarily focused on **Graph Data Mining** and **AI4Sec**, and you can find some of my representative works here:
